What are the factors that can help us predict how well each US state is doing in terms of women's health?

Using data from the CDC and the The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, an analysis of various factors including percentage of women aged 19-65 who are uninsured, percentage of women without a primary care physician, racial demographics, number of heart disease deaths, and maternal mortality rates from each state was conducted. The impact of each of these factors on the percentage of women who report poor of fair health in each state was determined.
